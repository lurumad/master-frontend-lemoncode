# Master Front End XVII - MÃ³dulo 4.1 - Frameworks - React Lab

Supplier Orders project for the Master Front End XVII at Lemoncode.

## Description

The proposed model is an Order (advanced users can also manage the list of orders).

The rules are simple:

- The order has a header with general information such as the order number, date, and customer.
- Each order consists of multiple order lines, each specifying the item being requested and its corresponding amount.
- When the amount of an order line is modified, the total order amount is updated.
- Each order line can be validated or invalidated (returning to a pending state).
- The order can only be submitted if all order lines are validated.
- The order status indicates the percentage of validated lines; for example, an order with half of its lines validated will be at 50%.
