# Master Front End XVII - MÃ³dulo 4.1 - Frameworks - React Lab

Basic React Lab project for the Master Front End XVII at Lemoncode.

## Description

This project is a basic React project that uses the Github API to fetch the members of an organization:

- By default shows the members of the Lemoncode organization.
- Shows an input to search for a specific organization.
- Shows a detail page with the user profile information.
- Allows to back to the list of members keeping the state of the list.
- Adds pagination to the list of members.
- Uses Material-UI components.

## Getting Started

## Github Api Rate Limit

This project uses the Github API to fetch the repositories of a user. The Github API has a rate limit of 60 requests per hour for unauthenticated requests. If you reach the limit. This project adds a [MockApiProvider](src/test/mockApiProvider.tsx) that mocks the API responses. You can use this provider by changing the [App.tsx](src/App.tsx) file.

```typescript
import { Router } from "@/core/router/Router";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { MockApiProvider } from "./test/MockApiProvider";
import { ListStateProvider } from "./core/list-state/list-state.context";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <MockApiProvider>
      <ListStateProvider>
        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
          <Router />
        </QueryClientProvider>
      </ListStateProvider>
    </MockApiProvider>
  );
};
```
